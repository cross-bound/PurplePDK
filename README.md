Purple PDK is a redesign of the Original FreePDK and FreePDK_lite. It was a challange to myself and practice PCB design.
The board is a 4 layer board with the two inner layers being solid ground planes. The size of the PCB is such that it can be
ordered unassambled from JLCPCB for $2 (as of the time of this writing).

Oscillator was updated to a Ceramic SMD type. The mircoUSB port was changed to Type-C.
Also added was a ESD protection IC which may or may not be needed.
